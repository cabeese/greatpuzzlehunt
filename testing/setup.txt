1. Get a recent Ruby version installed (>= 3.0)

   MacOS:
	* Using MacPorts:
	    sudo port install ruby31
	    sudo port select ruby ruby31
	    add to $PATH: $HOME/.gem/ruby/ruby/3.1.0/bin
	    sudo gem update --system --verbose --no-document
	    sudo gem update --verbose --no-document
	    
   Linux:
	* Using rvm:
	    (install curl and gnupg2 if not in the base installation)
	    gpg2 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
	    curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
	    rvm install 3.1
	    rvm use 3.1 --default
	    gem update --system --verbose --no-document
	    gem update --verbose --no-document
	* Using apt (Ubuntu):
	    sudo apt-get install ruby-full

2. Install the Ruby Selenium interface

   gem install selenium-webdriver --verbose --no-document --user-install

3. Install the web drivers for browsers

   The Selenium tools use the W3C webdriver interface to communicate
   between the the test cases and a web browser. The set of web
   drivers to install depends on the browsers to be tested against.

   The web driver binary should be downloaded from the sources below
   and installed in some directory in your $PATH.  (Recommended:
   install in $HOME/bin)

   * Firefox

     The geckodriver binary can be installed from
     https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

   * Chrome

     The chromedriver binary can be installed from
     https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

   * Safari

     When running on MacOS (the only system that supports Safari), the
     webdriver interface is included in Safari and nothing extra need
     be installed
   
4. Install the test runner interface

   Test runner is a web interface for running Ruby minitest test
   cases.

   Download the testrunner gem from
   https://chrysaetos.org/extras/testrunner-0.1.7.gem

   Then run
   gem install <dir>/testrunner-0.1.7.gem --no-document --user-install

   where <dir> is the directory where the gem was downloaded

5. Set up the test configuration

   This sets basic parameters for what server instance should be used
   for testing, and what the admin account on that server is

   Rename config-example.rb to config.rb

   Edit the config.rb file:
     :site is the URL for the test instance
     :adminuser is the email address for an admin account
     :adminpw is the password for that admin account
     :browsers is the list of browsers to test against. The default
       is [:firefox, :safari, :chrome]. Only include those browsers
       that are locally installed on the test system

6. Run tests

   Cd to the tests directory, then run

   tr2 --port 7100 --dir . --name 'gph'

   (Replace the port with another port number if needed)

   http://localhost:7100

   in a local browser, and you should see a list of all the test
   cases.

   The "Run all" button will run all the tests; a colored block will
   appear by each test as it is queued up, passes, or fails. The
   "Delete old logs" and "Delete all logs" clean up old logs or all
   test logs, as appropriate.

   To run a single test, use the "Run" button by the test. To see the
   details of the test result, use the "Log" button by the test. 

   If multiple tests have been set to run, they will be run in a
   random order.
