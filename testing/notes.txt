Notes on the unit tests

1. All users that are created in the tests should have the City in
   their address set to the constant CITY_MARKER. This is used to
   automatically clean out all users created by unit tests, even when
   the tests fail.

   Do not use this string in the City field if you don't want those
   user entries to be deleted.
